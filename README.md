# MyInstagram

## An Instagram iOS App Clone

### Project Description

#### Background
Hello fellow coder :wave:. Once, I was curious about what goes into the creation of a social media app. Naturally, I just looked it up and found a tutorial on how to build one similar to Facebook's Instagram :grin:. 
<br>
#### App Details
* Design and UI: This app contains all the features of a fully functioning social networking app similar to Instagram (likes, comments, posts, follow, login, and signup).
* Programming language used: Swift.
### How to View My Project
* Install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) on macOS.
* Choose 'clone an existing project'.<br>
